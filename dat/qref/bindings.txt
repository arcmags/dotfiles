Bindings
========

The search for a uniform set of (vim-like) bindings across all apps is a never
ending battle.

Applications
============

- bash
- firefox
- i3
- ipython
- irssi
- mocp
- newsboat
- qutebrowser
- tmux
- vim
- w3m
- xterm
- zathura
- mpv
- qmk

Ideas and Goals
===============

- uniform readline editing bindings
- keep as many defaults as possible while not be limited by them
- d, u as scroll down, up (i.e. c-d, c-u or m-d, m-u)
- n, p as next, previous buffer, tab, screen, etc...
- c-j, c-k as history next, previous
- c-n, c-p as autocomplete next, previous
