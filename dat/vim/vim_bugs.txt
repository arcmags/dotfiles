listed help buffer numbers
==========================

If numbers are set globally, and a listed help buffer has local numbers *off*,
local numbers for that buffer are reset to *on* every time the buffer is entered.

How to repeat in ``vim --clean <somefile>``::

   :set number
   :help help
   <c-w>o
   :setlocal buflisted
   :bnext
   :bnext
   :setlocal nonumber
   :bnext
   :bnext

Every time you return to the help buffer, numbers are magically re-enabled. I
looked at */usr/share/vim/vim90/ftplugin/help.vim* but nothing there is turning
numbers back on. I looked at all active autocommands and nothing appeared to be
setting line numbers there.

readonly warning in vim9script functions
========================================

:bnext vs :bnext!
